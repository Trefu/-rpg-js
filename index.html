                    <h2>Rogue</h2>
                    <p>The rogue or thief is one of the standard playable character classes in most editions of the
                        Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game.[1] A rogue is a versatile character, capable of
                        sneaky combat and nimble tricks. The rogue is stealthy and dexterous, and in early editions was
                        the only official base class from the Player's Handbook capable of finding and disarming traps
                        and picking locks. The rogue also has the ability to "sneak attack" ("backstab" in previous
                        editions) enemies who are caught off-guard or taken by surprise, inflicting extra damage.</p>
